In the era of digital world, traditional art of writing is being replaced by digital art. There is a difference between the digital  and traditional art.  The traditional way includes pen and paper, chalk and board method of writing. The essential aim of digital art is of building hand gesture recognition system to write digitally. Digital art includes many ways of writing like by using keyboard, touch-screen surface, digital pen, stylus, using electronic hand gloves, etc.

Use of this porject in real life:
1. Deaf people can use it for effective communication. As we know that it is very difficult to interact with deaf people. But using this we can write everything on screen and they can easily reply back in the same manner.
2. Senior citizens or people who find it difficult to use keyboards will able to use system effortlessly. 
3. In future, this system can also be used to control IOT devices shortly. This system will be an excellent software for smart wearables using which people could better interact with the digital world.
4. It can also be used to make classroom dust less. Many of the schools are not able to afford Interactive white board as they are very costly. But this can be a replacement for this.


In This project people can draw/write on screen just by waving his/ her finger without any keyboard. User can draw in four different colours, can change colours without any problem and even clear the board easily. There will be no need to touch the computer once the program is running. 
A coloured object at the tip of finger is used as a marker. The motion of that coloured tip is detected and mask is produced. According to that, patterns are drawn on the screen.

Libraries used:
1. Open CV
2. Numpy

No dataset is used as there is no training of model neede in this project. It run live.
